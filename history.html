      <p>The Roman Empire began on the Italian Peninsula, where the city of Rome grew from a small settlement into a powerful republic and eventually a vast empire. Italy was the heart of Roman political, cultural, and military life, home to the Senate, the Colosseum, and the empire’s central roads. From Italy, Rome expanded its influence across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, shaping law, language, engineering, and government for centuries to come. Even after the empire fell, Italy remained filled with Roman ruins and traditions that continue to reflect its ancient past. </p>

      <p>Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, a city in what is now Italy, and his early life there shaped his future as a navigator and explorer. Growing up in a major maritime center, he learned sailing, mapmaking, and trade from an early age. Although he later sailed for Spain, his Italian roots influenced his skills and ambitions, inspiring his vision of reaching Asia by crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Columbus’s voyages, beginning in 1492, opened the way for European exploration of the Americas, and his Italian heritage remains an important part of his story. </p>

      <p> The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci in Florence Italy around the early 1503 for a local merchant named Francesco del Giocondo. Though the painting eventually made its way to France where it still hangs today, it’s very much an Italian creation, shaped by the culture, artistry, and atmosphere of Renaissance Florence.
